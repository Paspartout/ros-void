> scripts, notes and patches to install [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) Kinetic
> on [Void Linux](http://www.voidlinux.eu/).

This repository contains scripts to automatically install
[ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) from source on the
Void Linux distribution.

Scripts
-------

### install-minimal.sh

This script installs all dependencies for ROS Kinetic in its minimal configuration.

To run the script you have to call it with root privileges.
The scripts drops it root privileges when called using sudo to create a
ROS workspace that is writable by the non-root user.

	$ sudo ./install-minimal.sh

Notes
-----

The scripts are mainly an automated way of installing ROS Kinetic from source.
It resembles the operations of the following guide in the ROS wiki:
[Installing from source](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Source)

I had to manually install [`console_bridge`](https://github.com/ros/console_bridge) 
before building.
Also, [`rospkg/os_detect.py`](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rospkg/blob/master/src/rospkg/os_detect.py)
had to be patched in order to detect Void Linux as a valid OS.
See Patches below for the actual modifications.

It may be worth the work to add Void Linux as a rosdep platform.
Documentation and Tutorials about rosdep can also be found in
the ROS wiki: [rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep/Tutorials)

Patches
-------

### os_detect.py.patch

This patch adds a detector class for Void Linux. Without this patch
rosdep won't accept Void Linux as a valid Linux distribution.
